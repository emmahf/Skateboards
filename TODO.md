## Todo List (in no particular order)

* Save multiple navgrids
* Fix terrain managment so its not hardcoded
** Save as data file
** Parse to get enum etc
* Add so that enemies can be killed (change counter and move to end)
* Make platform independent
* Make all entities have a draw / update functions
** Some kind of generic interface so that we can loop over them and just draw them)
* GLOBAL SIM TIME!
** Step1) Really need to fix so that we can have accurate velocities and not be frame dependent. 
** StepN) Make it slightly more advanced and use leftover/prediction
* Seperate NavGrid from visual terrain
* Add Controls
* Add multiple view (split screen kinda)
